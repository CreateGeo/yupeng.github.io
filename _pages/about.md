I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank"> Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab</a> (ESIIL), an NSF data synthesis center at CU Boulder, mentored by <a href="https://www.carlboettiger.info/index.html" target="_blank"> Carl Boettiger</a>.

I hold a PhD from Drexel University where I studied operations research and computational data science, advised by <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/handebenson" target="_blank"> Hande Benson</a>. My work concentrated on nonlinear optimization, later shifting focus to environmental applications of optimization.  Prior to this, I earned a BS in mathematics from the University of Utah and was a research assistant in <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u0028684-FREDERICK_R_ADLER/hm/index.hml" target="_blank"> Fred Adler's lab</a>. 


My research utilizes AI and mathematical optimization to tackle challenges in biodiversity conservation. In particular, my work targets 30x30 (preserving 30% of the Earthâ€™s lands and waters by 2030) by leveraging computational methods to support spatial planning and decision-making. As a postdoc, I am working to develop open science decision tools that address environmental goals while also prioritizing the needs and rights of those affected by these decisions.
