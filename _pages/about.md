I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Decision Sciences & MIS Department at Drexel University.

I'm interested in how optimization models can be applied to environmental problems, specifically for conservation and natural resource management decisions. The 30x30 initative&mdash;preserving 30% of the earth's land and sea by 2030&mdash;is a particular interest of mine and I'd love to explore the situations where optimization and machine learning could responsibly support this goal. 

**I am currently on the job market and am looking for a postdoctoral research position.** I am especially interested in positions at inclusive and diverse interdisciplinary labs. 

## Background 

My background is in operations research, where I focus on continuous and mixed-integer programming, particularly in solving large-scale optimization problems with applications in machine learning and computational sustainability.  I am advised by Professor Hande Benson. The bulk of my dissertation work was developing a quasi-Newton algorithm to solve large-scale nonlinear optimization problems more efficiently. This algorithm is applicable to problems that require a fast solution when optimizing over big&mdash;and often messy&mdash;datasets (e.g. training neural networks).

In addition to my Ph.D. studies, I will earn a graduate minor in Computational Data Science and am a member of the Drexel CS Theory Reading Group. Prior to this, I did math biology research as an undergraduate with Professor Fred Adler at the University of Utah and worked on math models for treating prostate cancer.
