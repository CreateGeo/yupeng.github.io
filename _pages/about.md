I'm an incoming postdoctoral associate at CU Boulder in the NSF Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (<a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank">ESIIL</a>).

As a mathematician with expertise in operations research and computational data science, I utilize AI and optimization to address challenges in biodiversity conservation. My research targets the 30x30 initiative—preserving 30\% of the earth’s lands and waters by 2030--by leveraging optimization models for spatial planning and decision-making. 

During my postdoc at ESIIL, I will explore how optimization can support 30x30 from an inclusive lens. As 30x30 efforts continue, we need frameworks that are flexible enough to center not only environmental goals, but also the needs and rights of people affected by the establishment of new protected areas. I aim to develop open science decision tools that 1) promote state-of-the-art optimization methods to a wide ecological audience 2) are better designed to yield more equitable solutions and 3) effectively communicate the framework and results to communities impacted by these decisions.
