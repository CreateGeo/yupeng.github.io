My full name is Cassidy but please call me Cassie. My pronouns are she/her. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Decision Sciences & MIS Department](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/faculty-and-research/disciplines/decision-sciences-and-mis) at Drexel University. My research area is operations research, where I focus specifically on continuous and mixed-integer programming, particularly in solving large-scale optimization problems with applications in machine learning. My advisor is [Hande Y. Benson](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/handebenson). I am also a member of the [Drexel CS Theory Reading Group](http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html), ran by [Vasilis Gkatzelis](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~gkatz/). 


I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at the [University of Utah](https://www.math.utah.edu/) where I worked on mathematical models for treating prostate cancer. My undergraduate research advisor is [Frederick R. Adler](https://faculty.utah.edu/u0028684-FREDERICK_R_ADLER/hm/index.hml)
