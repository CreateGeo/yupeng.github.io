My full name is Cassidy but please call me Cassie. My pronouns are she/her. 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Decision Sciences & MIS Department at Drexel University.

## Research Interests  

I'm interested in how optimization models can be applied to environmental problems, specifically for conservation and natural resource management decisions. The <a href="https://conservationcorridor.org/what-is-30x30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30x30</a> initative&mdash;preserving 30% of the earth's land and sea by 2030&mdash;is a particular interest of mine and I'd love to explore the situations where optimization and machine learning could responsibly support this goal. 

**I am currently on the job market and am looking for a postdoctoral research position.** I am especially interested in positions at inclusive and diverse interdisciplinary labs. 

## Background 

My background is in operations research, where I focus on continuous and mixed-integer programming, particularly in solving large-scale optimization problems with applications in machine learning and computational sustainability.  I am advised by <a href="https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/handebenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Hande Benson</a>. The bulk of my dissertation work was developing a quasi-Newton algorithm to solve large-scale nonlinear optimization problems more efficiently. This algorithm is applicable to problems that require a fast solution when optimizing over big&mdash;and often messy&mdash;datasets (e.g. training neural networks).

In addition to my Ph.D. studies, I will earn a graduate minor in Computational Data Science and am a member of the <a href="http://theory.cs.drexel.edu/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Drexel CS Theory Reading Group</a>.  Prior to this, I did math biology research as an undergraduate with <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u0028684-FREDERICK_R_ADLER/hm/index.hml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fred Adler</a> at the University of Utah and worked on math models for treating prostate cancer.
