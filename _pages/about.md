I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the Decision Sciences & MIS Department at Drexel University. 

I'm interested in how optimization models can be applied to environmental problems, specifically for conservation and natural resource management decisions. The 30x30 initative&mdash;preserving 30% of the earth's land and sea by 2030&mdash;is a particular interest of mine and I'd love to explore the situations where optimization and machine learning could responsibly support this goal. 

**I am currently on the job market and am looking for a postdoctoral research position.** I am especially interested in positions at inclusive and diverse interdisciplinary labs. 

## Background 
My background is in operations research at the boundary of optimization and machine learning, focusing on computational methods for mixed-integer and derivative-free optimization. I am advised by Professor Hande Benson. 

In addition to my Ph.D. studies, I will earn a graduate minor in Computational Data Science and am a member of the Drexel CS Theory Reading Group. Prior to this, I did math biology research as an undergraduate with Professor Fred Adler at the University of Utah and worked on math models for treating prostate cancer.
