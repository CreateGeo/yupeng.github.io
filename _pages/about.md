I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the Decision Sciences & MIS Department at Drexel University. 

My research is at the boundary of optimization and machine learning, focusing on computational methods for mixed-integer and derivative-free optimization. I'm interested in using these tools to tackle environmental problems, specifically for conservation and natural resource management decisions. The 30x30 initiative&mdash;preserving 30% of the earth's land and sea by 2030&mdash;is a particular interest of mine and I'd love to explore the situations where optimization and machine learning could responsibly support this goal. 

**I am currently on the job market and am looking for a postdoctoral research position.** I am especially interested in positions at inclusive and diverse interdisciplinary labs.

## Background 
My background is in operations research where the bulk of my dissertation work was developing a quasi-Newton algorithm to solve large-scale nonlinear optimization problems more efficiently.  This algorithm is applicable to problems that require a fast solution when optimizing over big—and often messy—datasets (e.g. training neural networks). I am advised by Dr. Hande Benson. 

In addition to my Ph.D. studies, I will earn a graduate minor in Computational Data Science and am a member of the Drexel CS Theory Reading Group. Prior to this, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Utah where I studied mathematical models for treating prostate cancer with Dr. Fred Adler.
