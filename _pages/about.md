I'm an incoming postdoctoral associate at CU Boulder in the NSF Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (<a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank">ESIIL</a>).


Given my background in mathematics and operations research, I utilize optimization to tackle challenges in biodiversity conservation decision-making. In particular, I focus on computational methods for nonlinear programming, mixed-integer nonlinear programming, and derivative-free optimization, all of which have applications in spatial planning. 


During my postdoc, my research will explore how optimization can support the 30x30 initiative--preserving 30% of the earthâ€™s lands and waters by 2030--from an inclusive lens. I aim to develop algorithms that are flexible enough to center not only environmental goals, but also the needs and rights of people affected by the establishment of new protected areas.
