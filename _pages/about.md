My research utilizes machine learning and optimization to tackle challenges in biodiversity conservation and natural resource management decisions. 

I have a background in mathematics and operations research where my earlier dissertation work focused on developing algorithms to solve large-scale nonlinear optimization problems more efficiently.
Midway through my Ph.D., I became more concerned with AIâ€™s impact on society. As such, I transitioned my research to align with environmental applications and began developing computational tools to aid conservation decision-makers.
