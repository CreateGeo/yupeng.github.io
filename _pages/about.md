I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the <a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank"> Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab</a> (ESIIL), an NSF data synthesis center at CU Boulder, mentored by Carl Boettiger. I hold a PhD from Drexel University where I studied operations research and computational data science. Prior to this, I earned a BS in mathematics from the University of Utah. 


My research utilizes AI and mathematical optimization to tackle challenges in biodiversity conservation. In particular, <a href="https://cu-esiil.github.io/AI-opt-decision-making/" target="_blank"> my work at ESIIL</a> focuses on developing open science decision tools that address environmental goals while also prioritizing the needs and rights of those affected by these decisions. This project targets California 30x30 (preserving 30% of California's lands and coastal waters by 2030) by leveraging computational methods to support planning and decision-making.
