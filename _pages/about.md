I'm a postdoctoral fellow at CU Boulder in the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (<a href="https://esiil.org/" target="_blank">ESIIL</a>). I hold a PhD from Drexel University where I studied operations research and computational data science. Prior to this, I earned a BS in mathematics from the University of Utah. 



My research utilizes AI and optimization to tackle challenges in biodiversity conservation. In particular, my work targets 30x30 (preserving 30% of the Earthâ€™s lands and waters by 2030) by leveraging computational methods to support spatial planning and decision-making. As a postdoc, I am working to develop open science decision tools that address environmental goals while also prioritizing the needs and rights of those affected by these decisions.
