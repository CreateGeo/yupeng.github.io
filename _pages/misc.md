This is a collection of projects I worked on during my undergraduate and graduate classes. This work is not at the same caliber as my research, however, these projects provided a space for me to grow and develop as a researcher and deserve mentioning. 

### Finding Waldo 
- Inspired by <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randal Olsen's work</a>, I apply k-means clustering, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and nearest neighbors to look for "optimal" search paths to find Waldo.

### Predicting How Fish Swim with Neural Networks
- Using a fish's fin flapping frequency, distance between fins, and lateral force, we used machine learning to predict a fish's phase difference and thrust.

### Forecasting Top 10 Songs on Billboard Hot 100 Chart
- I used the Spotify's API to collect the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 2010-2020. There are about 1100 songs with the corresponding audio features. More information on the data features can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features). Data can be provided upon request.

###  Am I the Asshole? 
- The objective of this project was to create a dataset. I used Redditâ€™s API to collect responses from [r/AmITheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/). Data can be provided upon request.

### How Donald Trump Engages Twitter
- We collected data from Donald Trump's Twitter account to study the type of tweets that get the most interactions. I am most proud of the photoshopped Twitter logo, as it is clear evidence of underutilized artistic prowess.
