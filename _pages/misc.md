## Passion(?) Projects 
This is a collection of projects I worked on during my undergraduate and graduate classes. Although these projects are not at the same caliber as research papers, these projects provided a space for me to grow and develop as a researcher and deserve mentioning. 

### Finding Waldo 
- Class: OPR 922 (Operations Research Methods I) @ Drexel 
- Inspired by [Randal Olsen's work](http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/), I apply k-means clustering, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and nearest neighbors to look for "optimal" search paths to find Waldo.

### Predicting How Fish Swim with Neural Networks
- Class: CS 510 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence) @ Drexel 
- Using a fish's fin flapping frequency, distance between fins, and lateral force, we used machine learning to predict a fish's phase difference and thrust.

### Predicting Top 10 Songs on Billboard Hot 100 Chart
- Class: DSCI 521 (Data Analysis and Interpretation)  @ Drexel 
- I used the Spotify's API to collect the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 2010-2020. There are about 1100 songs with the corresponding audio features. More information on the data features can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-audio-features). Data can be provided upon request.

###  Am I the Asshole? 
- Class: DSCI 511 (Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing) @ Drexel 
- The objective of this project was to create a dataset. I used Reddit’s API to collect responses from the [r/AmITheAsshole subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/). Data can be provided upon request.

### How Donald Trump Engages Twitter
- Class: CS 5140 (Data Mining) @ University of Utah
- We collected data from Donald Trump's Twitter account to study the type of tweets that get the most interactions. I am most proud of the photoshopped Twitter logo, as it is clear evidence of underutilized artistic prowess.

### Divine Nature, Individual Worth, Virtue and its Harmful Effects on Young Women in the LDS Church
- Class: GNDR 3960 (Mormonism and Gender) @ University of Utah 
- Despite the abundance of grammatical and formatting errors, this essay is one of my favorites. The paper itself isn't well written, but it's raw and genuine, and I like it. 
- *"The reason why the women are important is because of their future contributions to the Celestial Kingdom. It is not because of whom they are as a person. It is not because of their love for themselves. It is because of what they have to “offer” to their Heavenly Father. According to the church, these young women are in debt to their religion. It’s not about what they can do for themselves; it’s not about them as a person at all. The LDS Church believes that these thoughts are selfish. The women of the LDS church’s lives are supposed to be about their husbands and their children and most importantly—their Heavenly Father."*
