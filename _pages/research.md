# Other

### REU Research Project
C. K. Buhler, R. S. Terry, K. G. Link, F. R. Adler, "Mathematical modeling of adaptive therapy in prostate cancer," *Undergraduate Research Journal*, 2019. <a href="https://our.utah.edu/undergraduate-research-journal/undergraduate-research-journal-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Available online.</a>
- Using the Lotka-Volterra model, we studied how the timing and duration of hormone therapy impact the cancer cell burden when treating prostate cancer. 
- This project was the foundation of later work which delved deeper into cancer cell responses to treatment with various mathematical models.

### Class Projects 

Finding Waldo (2021)
- Inspired by <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randal Olsen's work</a>, I apply k-means clustering, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and nearest neighbors to look for "optimal" search paths to find Waldo.

Predicting How Fish Swim with Neural Networks (2021)
- Given a fish's fin flapping frequency, distance between fins, and lateral force, we used machine learning to predict a fish's phase difference and thrust. 
-  <a href="/files/FishSwim-BuhlerKadapa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report available here.</a>


Forecasting Top 10 Songs on Billboard Hot 100 Chart (2021)
- I used APIs for Spotify and Billboard to collect audio features for the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 2010-2020. Given these audio features, I utilized shallow neural networks and feature selection to predict which songs will be in the top 10.
- <a href="https://github.com/cassiebuhler/ForecastingBillboardHot100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code and data are published on Github.</a>

Am I the Asshole? (2020)
- The objective of this project was to create a dataset. I used Redditâ€™s API to collect responses from [r/AmITheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/). 
- <a href="https://github.com/cassiebuhler/AmITheAsshole-DataCollection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code and data are published on Github.</a>

How Donald Trump Engages Twitter (2019)
- We collected data from Donald Trump's Twitter account to study the type of tweets that get the most interactions. I am most proud of the photoshopped Twitter logo, as it is clear evidence of underutilized artistic prowess.
