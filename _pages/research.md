### REU Project
Mathematical modeling of adaptive therapy in prostate cancer (2019)

*Mentors: Rebecca S. Terry, Kathryn G. Link, Frederick R. Adler*
- Using the Lotka-Volterra model, we studied how the timing and duration of hormone therapy impact the cancer cell burden when treating prostate cancer. 
- This project was the foundation of later work which delved deeper into cancer cell responses to treatment with various mathematical models.

### Class Projects 

Finding Waldo (2021)
- Inspired by <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randal Olsen's work</a>, I apply k-means clustering, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and nearest neighbors to look for "optimal" search paths to find Waldo. 
-  <a href="/files/FindingWaldo-Buhler.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report available here.</a>

Predicting How Fish Swim with Neural Networks (2021)
- Given a fish's fin flapping frequency, distance between fins, and lateral force, we used machine learning to predict a fish's phase difference and thrust.
