### Miscellaneous - Cool Projects 
*Here are some fun projects I worked on in my undergraduate and graduate classes.*


#### Finding Waldo 
- Inspired by <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2015/02/03/heres-waldo-computing-the-optimal-search-strategy-for-finding-waldo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Randal Olsen's work</a>, I apply k-means clustering, ant colony optimization, genetic algorithms, and nearest neighbors to look for "optimal" search paths to find Waldo. 
-  <a href="/files/FindingWaldo-Buhler.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report available here.</a>

#### Forecasting Top 10 Songs on Billboard Hot 100 Chart
- I used Spotify's API to collect the Billboard Hot 100 songs from 2010-2020. There are about 1100 songs with the corresponding audio features. Using these audio features, I try to predict which songs will be in the top 10. The features are collected using Spotify API. 
- <a href="https://github.com/cassiebuhler/ForecastingBillboardHot100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code and data are published on Github.</a>

#### How Donald Trump Engages Twitter
- We collected data from Donald Trump's Twitter account to study the type of tweets that get the most interactions. I am most proud of the photoshopped Twitter logo, as it is clear evidence of underutilized artistic prowess.
