The software used in the paper [Regularized Step Directions in Conjugate Gradient Minimization for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06308) is available for open source download on [GitHub](https://github.com/cassiebuhler/ConminCG).

%We have reimplemented conjugate gradient method of Conmin in C and connected it to AMPL.  In our C implementation, we have omitted the BFGS method also implemented in the original Conmin distribution, and we will call our new %code *Conmin-CG*. The cubic regularization scheme proposed in our paper as Algorithm 2 was implemented and tested by modifying this software, and is called *Conmin-CG with Cubic Regularization*.

%In addition, we implemented the same code in MATLAB to compare to ADMM.
