## Conmin-CG: Hybrid Cubic Regularization of Conjugate Gradient Minimization Method

*An optimization algorithm with memoryless and matrix-free properties that solves large-scale problems more efficiently by improving step quality with cubic regularization.*
- Implemented in C, MATLAB, and Python.
- This software was used in the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regularized Step Directions in Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods</a> and Regularized Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods for Machine Learning.
