## Conmin-CG *(Hybrid Cubic Regularization of Conjugate Gradient Minimization Method)*

Conmin-CG is available for open source download on Github. <a href="https://github.com/cassiebuhler/ConminCG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linked here</a>.

This software was used in the papers <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regularized Step Directions in Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods</a> and Regularized Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods for Machine Learning. We have implemented Conmin-CG in C, MATLAB, and Python.
