I have taught and assisted dozens of courses in the LeBow College of Business at Drexel University. I aim to demystify STEM topics (e.g. coding) by providing a safe environment to make mistakes and ask questions. My goal isn't to push students to become statisticians or data scientists. My goal is to provide students with more tools in their toolbox as they pursue their chosen careers.
