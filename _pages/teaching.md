Throughout my PhD, I taught and assisted dozens of classes in the Decision Sciences & MIS Department at Drexel University.

I aim to demystify STEM topics (e.g. coding) by providing a safe environment to make mistakes and ask questions. My goal isn't to push students to become statisticians or data scientists. Rather, I strive to equip students with more tools to navigate their careers in our data-abundant world.
